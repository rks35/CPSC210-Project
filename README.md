CPSC 210 - Software Construction 

WAYFINDER ANDROID APP

Working in teams of 2, the goal of this project was to construct an Android Application, 
which would track the progress of buses serving a particular stop in the Lower Mainland, BC.

We parsed JSON data from Translink's database (BC's Transportation Organization).

Further, we utilized JUnit testing and debugging methods.
